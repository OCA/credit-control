Of course, before sending invoice reminders, you must import your bank statements and process them, so that you are up-to-date on customer payments.

Then, go to the menu *Invoicing > Accounting > Actions > Overdue Invoice Remind*: you will get the start screen where you can:

* filter the customers that you want to remind (filter by customer or by salesman),
* check that your bank journals are up-to-date,
* choose between the *one-by-one* and *mass* interfaces,
* customize some parameters.

Then follow the process until the end.

You can also start the invoice reminder wizard via the button *Overdue Reminder* on an overdue invoice.
