ensure that once sales are made they are realised as cash. This module helps to

Configuration
=============

Configure the policies and policy levels in ``Invoicing  > Configuration >
Credit Control > Credit Control Policies``.
You can define as many policy levels as you need. You must set on which
accounts are applied every Credit Control Policy under Accounts tab.

Configure a tolerance for the Credit control and a default policy
applied on all partners in each company, under the General Information tab in your
company form.

You are able to specify a particular policy for one partner or one invoice.

Usage
=====

Menu entries are located in *Invoicing > Credit Control*.

Create a new "run" in the *Credit Control Run* menu with the controlling date.
Then, use the *Compute Credit Lines* button. All the credit control lines will
be generated. You can find them in the *Credit Control Lines* menu.

On each generated line, you have many choices:

* Send a email
* Print a letter
* Change the state (so you can ignore or reopen lines)
* Mark a line as Manually Overridden. The line will get the ignored state when
  a second credit control run is done.
* Mark one line as Manual followup will also mark all the lines of the
  partner. The partner will be visible in "Do Manual Follow-ups".

Once your lines are properly set up, go back to the "run" and click on
*Run channel action* to massively generate and queue communication emails or
letters for all linked lines.

Then, use the *Communications* smart button to see all email communication
processes that have been created and follow them.
