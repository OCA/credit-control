Menu entries are located in *Invoicing > Adviser > Credit Control*.

Create a new "run" in the *Credit Control Run* menu with the controlling date.
Then, use the *Compute Credit Lines* button. All the credit control lines will
be generated. You can find them in the *Credit Control Lines* menu.

On each generated line, you have many choices:

 * Send a email
 * Print a letter
 * Change the state (so you can ignore or reopen lines)
 * Mark a line as Manually Overridden. The line will get the ignored state when
   a second credit control run is done.
 * Mark one line as Manual followup will also mark all the lines of the
   partner. The partner will be visible in "Do Manual Follow-ups".

Once your lines are properly set up, go back to the "run" and click on
*Run channel action* to massively generate and queue communication emails or
letters for all linked lines.

Then, use the *Communications* smart button to see all email communication
processes that have been created and follow them.
