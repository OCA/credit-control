This modules provide methods to generate `upflow.io <https://upflow.docs.apiary.io/>`_
HTTP API endpoint payloads without any method to communicate with the API.

This module is used by `edi_upflow`, we decide to separate payloads generation logic
from the edi framework in use.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
